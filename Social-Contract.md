## Core Principles

### D&D should be fun
Roleplaying is a game. Games should be fun. If it's not fun, it's okay to give feedback, ask for change, or quit.

### D&D should be cooperative
One person's fun shouldn't be at the expense of another's. Any conflict between in-game characters should be opt-in for all players involved. If your character refuses to vibe with the rest of the party, the DM may ask you to roll another character whose goals align better.

If you're not okay with something another player character did, discuss it with them out of character instead of reacting in character.

### D&D is based on trust
Trust is based on honesty, which is undermined by cheating or lying as a player (not necessarily as a character).

## Campaign
- Biweekly (every two weeks), on Sunday, 10AM PST / 6PM GMT, around 3 hours
- When does the campaign end? 
	- TODO: pending in-person group discussion.
- [Foundry VTT (Virtual Tabletop)](https://fvtt2.mustachecat.dev) _(Protip: bookmark this page and store your username / password securely!)_
- Food & alcohol are okay in moderation.
- Coordinate through Signal group chat.
- DnD5e sources for players (DM sources omitted):
	- Core: [Player's Handbook (PHB)](https://5e.tools/book.html#phb)
	- Supplemental: [Xanathar's Guide to Everything (XGE)](https://5e.tools/book.html#xge), [Tasha's Cauldron of Everything (TCE)](https://5e.tools/book.html#tce), [Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide (SCAG)](https://5e.tools/book.html#scag)
	- Any other officially published Wizards of the Coast (WotC) material or any Unearthed Arcana (UA) are okay, but the DM may decide against them as they arise if they're not balanced. Please wait for the DM's OK before adding any non-official material to your character.
	- [Table rules](./Table-Rules.md)

## Characters
Characters should be created with the party in mind. They should have a reason to cooperate with each other.

Your character's development is in your hands. The DM won't force a player's character into developing unless the DM & the player have had a talk and agreed upon the direction, if any, of the character's arc(s).

No evil characters in this campaign!

## Attendance
We're busy adults and there will inevitably be a scheduling conflict. If you're going to miss or be late to a session, please let the DM & party know via group chat. 1 day+ in advance is ideal, but it's understandable if the notice is shorter -- things happen.

In your absence, please determine who will be playing the character (DM or another player). The character will receive half XP from encounters.

## Rulings
The DM may need to make a judgement call during the game on rules. If you don't agree with the ruling, please bring it up after the session, not during.

After a session, we can look up rule disputes and set a precendent for next time.

The DM may go with "rule of cool" at times even when it may contradict "rules as written/intended".

## Focus & Crosstalk
There will be time to socialize at the beginning of the session. During the session itself, please try to keep your focus on the game.

During the session itself, please try not to get too sidetracked by coaching, such as telling someone what they can do on their turn. Allow a player to make their own decisions, even if the decisions may be suboptimal. Since we're all playing biweekly, let's keep things running and show up prepared. If a player has explicitly asked someone for help, allow that person to answer. If it's not clear who was asked, allow the DM a chance to answer.

In the first few sessions, everyone may need time to familiarize themselves with the interface and the rules, so we'll go a bit looser on this ask until everyone gets more familiar with everything.

## Inviting Others
D&D is an exciting group game, and you may end up talking about it with your friends that don't play. You may end up inviting these friends, or these friends may ask to play. 

Please run the idea of your friend joining or guesting by the DM & party *before* inviting a friend. This is because new additions will change the party dynamic, due to D&D games succeeding or failing based on player comfort & cooperation. Additionally, this results in more work for the DM. Finally, friend dynamics outside of D&D may differ greatly from dynamics within the game.

## Feedback
We'll leave a bit of time at the end of each session to debrief & give feedback. It's especially important for players to touch base with one another and the DM if there have been intense scenes or conflicts. For this purpose, we'll be using [Stars & Wishes](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/blog/stars-and-wishes).

If you don't like the way the game is going, talk to the DM. Tell the DM what you want to happen, what you wish had happened, and what you didn't like happening. This includes plot, character development, or player behavior at the table.

If you don't feel comfortable criticizing the game, ask someone else to relay your thoughts anonymously.

If someone complains to you about the game, relay it to the DM anonymously.

TODO: Discuss other ways to give feedback.

## Safety Tools
We want to make sure everyone feels welcome and comfortable at the table when playing. This is where safety tools come in. 

The lines & veils this party will abide by are listed below, and populated together during session 0.

You may realize a line or veil in the moment, when the campaign has begun. If you aren't comfortable with a topic, please [use the X-Card feature of the Anonymous Player in Foundry](./Foundry-VTT-Visual-Guide.md#using-the-x-card). This will result in the party pausing, and discussing out-of-character what should be changed about the current scenario.

### Lines
A line is a hard limit, somewhere we won't be going while roleplaying. The following lines are in effect:
- Sexual violence
- LGBTQIA+ discrimination
- TODO

### Veils
A veil is a soft limit or "fade to black" moment. A veil is part of the story, but not described. The following veils are in effect:
- Torture
- TODO
