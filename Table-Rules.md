# Table Rules

> To see the table of contents for this document, click the list icon by the filename at the top left of the README.

Table rules are rules that are DM's choice, or aren't explicitly written down. You do not need to read the entirety of these table rules before starting, as the DM will use these rules when related situations come up. When in doubt, refer to these rules and the DM for guidance.

If you're interested in a variant, homebrew, or rule option that's not listed below, please consult with the DM!

## Character Creation

### Character Ability Scores 
There are 3 options for character ability scores:

#### Preset Ability Scores (Standard Array)
Use the following numbers and assign them to the ability scores of your choosing:
```
15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8
```
After doing so, you may add any racial modifiers.

#### Customizing Ability Scores (Point Buy)
You have 27 points to spend on your ability scores. After you allocate your abilities, you may add racial modifiers. The cost of each score is shown in the table below:

Score | Cost
--- | ---
8 | 0
9 | 1
10 | 2
11 | 3
12 | 4
13 | 5
14 | 7
15 | 9

For example, using this method, `15, 15, 15, 8, 8, 8` is a possible outcome.

#### DM's Luck (Custom Array)
If all the players agree, the DM rolls a set of scores and everyone assigns those numbers to their ability scores. Rolls of 1-4 will be rerolled. After scores are assigned, racial modifiers are applied.

### Character Backgrounds
Characters in our starting region of Faerûn may come from a variety of backgrounds. The accepted backgrounds in this game may be found in the PHB (Player's Handbook) or SCAG (Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide). Your backstory can be seen as very general starting points that players can use as part of their backstories, personalities, or in the ways others react to them.

Follow [this link](https://5e.tools/backgrounds.html#baldur's%20gate%20acolyte_bgdia,flstsource:toa=0~aag=0~mot=0~egw=0~ggr=0~bgdia=0~ai=0~wbtw=0~gos=0~vrgr=0~cos=0~erlw=0~dsotdq=0~scc=0,flopsource:extend) for the list of backgrounds you can choose from. Be aware that our setting takes place quite far from Uthgardt or Waterdeep, so the features of those two backgrounds may not come into play until later in the game.

If you wish to choose a background outside this list, please consult with the DM.

### Character Races
Faerûn is a diverse world with many sprawling urban centers, where even traditionally evil races may not be given a second glance. However, exotic races are often regarded with mistrust or outright suspicion in smaller towns. If you are playing as an exotic or monstrous race, you should be aware of this, and the DM may ask you about to elaborate on your origins.

Exotic or monstrous races are defined as anything that's not a human, elf, dwarf, halfling, gnome, or half-elf. Duergar (grey dwarves) and Drow (grey elves), as traditional denizens of the Underdark, may also be regarded as monstrous races due to their history with Faerûn.

Follow [this link](https://5e.tools/races.html#custom%20lineage_tce,flstsource:dmg=0~eepc=0~egw=0~mpmm=0~aag=0~erlw=0~ggr=0~mot=0~vrgr=0~mtf=0~wbtw=0~idrotf=0~dsotdq=0~scc=0~ai=0,flopsource:extend,flstspeed:fly=2,flopspeed:extend,flsttraits:monstrous%20race=2,floptraits:extend,flstlanguages:common=1,floplanguages:extend) for a list of races you can choose from. If you wish to choose a race outside of this list, please consult with the DM.

### Character Classes
> Decision paralysis is real! If you're having trouble deciding, ask the DM will make some suggestions for you based on your playstyle.

PCs in Faerûn are able to take any of the standard PHB base classes, with some class and subclass additions for better balance and more options. For example, the Blood Hunter, which was adapted into official content but first used in [Critical Role](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_Role), is an available class.

Follow [this link](https://5e.tools/classes.html#artificer_tce) for a list of classes you can choose from. Blood Hunter won't immediately be visible; To import the Blood Hunter, from that link, click `Manage Homebrew` ->  `Get Homebrew` -> Click the title, not the check, for `Blood Hunter (2022)`. Refresh the page to see details about the Blood Hunter. See the individual links below for descriptions and options for each character.

As characters level up, there are a variety of subclasses you can choose from. The following are the available subclasses for each class for this campaign:
